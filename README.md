I created this app because I wanted to play around with Kotlin and also used it to try out some stuff.</br>
It has minSdk21 and uses the camera2 api, has app shortcuts and other things that might be interesting.</br>
It also uses Firebase for tracking and crash logging.
I also used it to find out how to shrink the apk size of apps (you can read more about it [here](http://sthagios.com/2016/08/29/reduce-apk-size) ),
I used it to play around with screengrab ([more information](http://sthagios.com/2016/07/31/automate-screenshots) ), therefore it also contains a screengrab file.</br>
